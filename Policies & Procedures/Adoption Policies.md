**USER/ADOPTER**
- Whisker and its participating rescues reserve the right to refuse the adoption of an animal due to past negligent or abuse behaviors of users. Such users will be flagged to other rescues so they are made aware.
- Adopters agree to care for their adopted animal to the best of their ability. If some unforeseen circumstance results in the relinquishment of the animal, the adopter will contact the rescue the animal was adopted from before surrendering elsewhere.
- Cat Specific: Adopters agree they will not declaw their cat. Doing so will be a violation of their adoption contract and rescues can refuse the adoption of another animal.
- Barn Cat Specific: Adopters agree they are able to provide shelter with cool and warm environments for their cat.
- Dog Specific: Adopters agree they are able to provide shelter with cool and warm environments for their dog.

- All animals must be up to date on vaccinations at the time of adoption
