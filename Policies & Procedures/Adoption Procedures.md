# Adoption Procedures
**Adopters & Users**  
- All adopters must complete their profile to be matched with an animal
- Survey results are shared with rescues in the area
- A match does not guarantee adoption, just compatibility
- Whisker and its participating rescues reserve the right to refuse the adoption of an animal due to past negligent or abuse behaviors of users. Such users will be flagged to other rescues so they are made aware

**Rescues**  
- A designated person from the rescue will approve or deny adopters
- All animals must be spayed or neutered at the time of adoption
- All animals must be up to date on vaccinations at the time of adoption
- All animals must be microchipped at the time of adoption
