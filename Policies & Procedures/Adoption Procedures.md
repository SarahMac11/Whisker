# Adoption Procedures
**Adopters & Users**  
- All users must create and complete their profile survey in order to request to join Whisker
- Users must be approved by Whisker in order to begin matching with pets
- Whisker and its participating rescues reserve the right to refuse the adoption of an animal due to past negligent or abusive behaviors of users. Such users will be informed of their denial with reasoning and flagged to other rescues so they are made aware.
- Survey results are shared with rescues in the area
- A match does not guarantee adoption, only compatibility
- When a match is made, the user can message the animal to arrange a meeting

**Rescues**  
- A designated person(s) from the rescue will approve or deny adopters for specified animals
- All animals must be spayed or neutered at the time of adoption
- All animals must be up to date on vaccinations at the time of adoption
- All animals must be microchipped at the time of adoption for preventative measures
- Rescues are responsible for maintaining their available animals and keeping animal statuses up to date. It is recommended for rescues to visit Whisker at least once daily, ideally multiple times a day.
- Rescues are able to view the user's survey and approve or deny the user to adopt the animal
- The generic Whisker user survey is used in place of the rescue's unique adoption application as it encompasses many aspects in many animal adoption applications
- When there are multiple interested adopters for an animals, the rescue can change the animal's status to "On Hold" to hide the animal from new users
- When the animal is no longer available, the rescue will change the animal's status to "Adopted"
- After adoption, the rescue will send all known medical history of the animal to the adopter
