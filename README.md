## Version Control

What version control method did you choose?
Git and GitHub

Why is this the best version control method for your group?

All members are familiar with and comfortable using GitHub as it has been a requirement in other courses. We have also encountered git tools in our internships and professional experiences. As the most popular VCS in the industry, we feel it is appropriate to use it. It is also a very appropriate choice for the nature of our application, as an Ionic project with a Node/Express backend server.
